Router is a device which connects Multiple Local Area networks.

In this session we are going to learn how to Connect 2
Local Area networks using Router

--------------------------------------------------------
take computers and the switch now let’s connect them with each other.
instead of manually selecting the cable let’s click on the automatic selection.

This will choose the best cable according to the device and connect it to the appropriate port.
Which in our case is a fast Ethernet port.

Our switch and PC both have this port.PC only has 1 FastEthernet port but switch has multiple ethernet ports.
You can check how many ports a switch has by hovering the mouse above the switch.

Switch takes some time to set up thats the reason we see orange dots
We can skip that waiting time by clicking on the fast forward button.

Lets assign IP addresses to all the 3 computers. IP address for the computers on this network are going to
be in order of 10.0.0.1 upto 10.0.0.3


---------------------------------------
Once the IP address is assigned to all the computers in this network we can bring the Router on the screen.
Router options are present in the bottom left menu. We have different options for the Routers but we are going
to go with the first on


Next step is to connect the Router with Switch.The cable needed for this connection is also copper
straight through.


But the port will be different on the router.
Our switch has the Fast Ethernet Port as well as Gigabit
Ethernet port.
But router has only Gigabit Ethernet port



Difference between these 2 ports is that gigabit Ethernet is faster than fast ethernet.
The maximum speed of data transmission on fast Ethernet is 100 MBPS but on the gigabit port it is 1000MBPS.

But there are other differences also such as gigabit is costly and it can be used to transmit data over long
range(upto 70 km).But fast ethernet can transmit over short distances only upto 10 KM.

----------------------------------------

In order to connect the 2 devices select the copper straight through cable and click on the switch. Here select the
Gigabit port


Our connection of the Router and the switch is done.But
we still are having red triangles on the wire.
Which means that these 2 devices are not connected
properly

There are 2 steps we need to perform in order to bring the router online.

First is by default the port of the router is turned off.
We need to turn that On.

For that double click on the router and go to the config tab and then in the bottom left select the gigabit 0 port.
Here you have the option to turn it on
